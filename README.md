# The "I Couldn't Think of Anything Better" Front-end Quizzical Web App

Welcome to yet another overhyped repository for a web app that's supposed to revolutionize your frontend quiz-taking experience. Strap in your seatbelts!

## What's this all about?

Just your frontend quiz app. Because the internet clearly didn't have enough of those already.

---

## Features (or lack thereof)

- **Questions**:  Stolen from somewhere on Stack Overflow, but who's keeping track?
- **Answers**: We even threw in some wrong ones just to keep you on your toes.
- **Scoring**: Because what's the point of taking a quiz if you don't get graded? Prepare for some arbitrary numbers to make you feel accomplished or useless.

## How to use (because you need instructions for everything)

1. **Clone this repository**: Seriously, if you're not sure how to do this, you might want to reconsider your career choices.
2. **Open index.html**: Wait, you don't know how to do this? Have you been living under a rock?
3. **Answer questions**: Click the right things.
4. **Submit**: Because even though it's a frontend quiz, we need some backend validation. Just kidding, we don't have backend. Submit anyway, it won't do anything.

## Contributions

Contributions? if you're feeling particularly generous with your time, feel free to fork this masterpiece and make it even more terrible. We won't lose any sleep over it.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues, it's probably because you're using Internet Explorer.

## License

Do whatever you want with it, but don't blame us if your cat starts speaking binary.
